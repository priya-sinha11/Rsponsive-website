                knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training,
                storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of
                educators, however learners can also educate themselves.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-sm">Takshasila was the earliest recorded centre of
                higher learning in India from possibly 8th century BCE, and it is debatable whether it could be regarded
                a university or not in modern sense, since teachers living there may not have had official membership of
                particular colleges, and there did not seem to have existed purpose-built lecture halls and residential
                quarters in Taxila, in contrast to the later Nalanda university in eastern India. Nalanda was the oldest
                university-system of education in the world in the modern sense of university.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-sm">The central board and most of the state boards uniformly follow the "10+2"
                pattern of education.:3 In this pattern, study of 10 years is done in schools and 2 years in Junior
                colleges (Mumbai, Maharashtra),:44 and then 3 years of study for a bachelor's degree for
                college. The first 10 years is further subdivided into 4 years of primary education, 6 years of High
                School followed by 2 years of Junior colleges.:5 This pattern originated from the recommendation of
                the Education Commission of 1964â€“66.
